# Credit Default Risk

## Overview

In this project, a comparative analysis of various machine learning and a deep learning model was carried out and the models, including random forest, decision tree, SVM (Support Vector Machine), XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting), ADABoost (ADAptive Boosting) and multilayered perceptron (MLP) with three-hidden layers, so as to predict credit default using loan data from LendingClub. The goal here was to identify the most effective model for predicting defaults. This project involved several stages, including data preparation, model training, evaluation, analysis and model deployment.
